Credit Card Approval Prediction using Artificial Neural Network
1. Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict credit card approval based on various features and historical approval data.

2. Data
The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle and consists of various features related to applicants and their credit card approval status. Additionally, there is another dataset (Credit_card_label.csv) that contains the labels for the credit card approvals.

3. Features
The dataset includes various features, such as gender, car ownership, property ownership, number of children, annual income, type of income, education level, marital status, housing type, and more. The label column indicates whether an application was approved (0) or rejected (1).

Data Preprocessing
* Handling missing values by filling them with appropriate values.
* Converting categorical features into numerical values using label encoding.
* Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of different features.

4. Modelling

* Shuffling the data to avoid order bias.
* Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
* Creating a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with multiple layers.
* Compiling the model with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
* Implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting.
* Training the model on the training data and validating it on the validation data.
* Evaluating the model's performance on the test data.

This project involves using machine learning techniques to predict credit card approval based on various applicant features. The model was designed to help financial institutions automate the approval process and make more informed decisions.

You can continue by tuning hyperparameters, improving the model's architecture, or deploying it for practical use.

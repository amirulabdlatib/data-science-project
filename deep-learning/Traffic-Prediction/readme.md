# Urban Traffic Prediction using Artificial Neural Network

## Overview

This project addresses urban traffic congestion by leveraging an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict traffic conditions. The ANN is trained on a diverse dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing features such as time, date, vehicle counts (cars, bikes, buses, trucks), and the day of the week. The target label categorizes traffic situations into Heavy, High, Normal, and Low.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: [Traffic Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibullahaman/traffic-prediction-dataset)

## Model Performance

The trained ANN achieved an impressive test accuracy of approximately 93.33%, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and predicting traffic patterns. This level of accuracy positions the model as a valuable tool for transportation planning, infrastructure development, and congestion management in urban areas.

## Project Structure

- `Data Preparation`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and categorical data encoding.
- `Modeling`: Implementation of the ANN using TensorFlow and Keras.
- `Evaluation`: Assessment of the model's performance, including accuracy metrics and confusion matrix.
- `Visualization`: Visual representation of model training history and architecture.


## Results

For detailed insights, refer to the complete [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/amirulabdlatib/data-science-project/blob/main/deep-learning/Traffic-Prediction/Traffic-Prediction.ipynb) in this repository.

## Future Work

- Fine-tuning the model for even better accuracy.
- Scaling the solution for real-world traffic management applications.
